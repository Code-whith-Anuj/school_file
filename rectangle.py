#write a program to find the area of a recangle given that its length is 10 unit and breadth is 20 unit

# Given length and breadth
length = 10
breadth = 20

# Calcuating the area of a recangle 
area = length * breadth

# Displaying the result
print(f"The are of the rectangle with length {length} and breadth {breadth} is : {area}")
